We will now fetch starter code that has defined APIGateway+Lambda stack. 

To fetch the stack, run the following command in your _Cloud9 Terminal_.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ishan-aws/cdk-pipelines-demo
```

![](/20-setup-and-explore/20-getting-starter-code/git_clone_execution.png)

You should now see a directory named `cdk-pipelines-demo` in your Cloud9 Environment

#### Troubleshooting
If there is no active terminal window, create one using the `+` icon.
