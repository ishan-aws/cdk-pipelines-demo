Create and deploy application triggered by Git Push using CDK(Python) 

It is accomplished through the **Code** suite of tools; 
AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy, and AWS CodePipeline. Together, they allow you to build a deployment pipeline for your application.

This workshop builds a simple API using APIGateway and Lambda. 
The API is deployed into two different environments; development and production.

To simulate a real world scenario, the workshop also shows how to add manual approval process before resources in production are deployed.
